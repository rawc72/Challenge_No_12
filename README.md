# Employee Tracker Application:
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are known as Content Management Systems (CMS). This application will provide a non-devloper the necessary tool to strucure its tracking by department, role and employee.


## User Story:
As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

## User experience:
Using the comand line, I execute the application that accepts user input.

When I start the application, then I am presented with the following options: 
    view all departments, 
    view all roles, 
    view all employees, 
    add a department, 
    add a role, 
    add an employee, 
    update an employee role, and
    exit

When I choose to view all departments, then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.

When I choose to view all roles, then I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.

When I choose to view all employees, then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.

When I choose to add a department, then I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.

When I choose to add a role, then I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.

When I choose to add an employee, then I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager and that employee is added to the database.

When I choose to update an employee role, then I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
